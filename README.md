This project is designed to show my comment regimen using variable name prefixes to denote the type and make it easy to access variables by type through autocomplete. 
Typing any given prefix will show the list of variables of that type within the auto complete popup.

The comments also show the individual steps that the code takes to complete the required task and demonstrates modularized code with the use of custom functions.

The project itself is a matrix calculator that solves a partial fraction integral.
