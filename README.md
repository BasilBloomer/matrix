This project is designed to show my comment regimen using variable name prefixes to denote the type, making it easy to access variables by type through autocomplete and making it easy for other developers to read the code. Typing any given prefix will show the list of variables of that type within the auto complete popup.

The comments also show the individual steps that the code takes to complete the required task and demonstrates modularized code with the use of custom functions.

The project itself is a matrix calculator that solves a partial fraction integral.
